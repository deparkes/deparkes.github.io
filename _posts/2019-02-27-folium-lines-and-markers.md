I was asked recently about adding multiple custom lines and markers to a <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/2016/05/13/python-leaflet-map-folium/">Folium map</a>.
<a href="https://github.com/python-visualization/folium">Folium</a> can be a bit funny about the order in which things are applied so below gives an example of how you can later lines and markers.
To make it easier to see which elements are which in the final output I have added some different colours.
