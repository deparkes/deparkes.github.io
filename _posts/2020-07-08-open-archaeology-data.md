Archaeology can be an interesting source of data for projects or exploring analytical techniques. This post contains a few sources of open archeology data which you may wish to refer to.
<h3>Journal of Open Archaeology Data</h3>
This isn't a repository of data itself, but the articles published in the <a href="https://openarchaeologydata.metajnl.com/">journal of open archaeology data</a> typically link to external data repositories. Being a journal rather than a specific repository means that you can find a diverse range of data to suit your interests or your project including things like maps, shapefiles and images.
<h3>Archaeology Data Service</h3>
The UK's <a href="https://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/">Archaeology Data Service</a> is a digital repository for heritage data. It can be a bit difficult to find detailed data, and may be more suited to exploring metadata of different studies and documents.
The data services is also available as a <a href="https://data.archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/page/">sparql end point</a> (read <a href="https://deparkes.co.uk/2015/11/30/good-sparql-tutorial/">more about sparql</a> and other <a href="https://deparkes.co.uk/2016/09/23/find-cool-data-with-these-sparql-endpoints/">sparql endpoints</a>)
<h3>GIS StackExchange</h3>
This now archived <a href="https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/33954/seeking-free-archaeology-datasets">question on StackExchange</a> lists a number of different sources of archaeology data. It is mostly skewed towards mapping data (it was a GIS question), but it's still a good entry point for more general data.
<h3>Data.World</h3>
The website <a href="https://data.world/search?q=archaeology">data.world</a> is a collaborative data sharing resource which requires a login to access the data, but it contains a growing list of diverse data sets including geophysics, lists of sites of interest and reports.
