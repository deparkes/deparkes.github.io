<h1>Choose GDS Export Settings</h1>
You will be presented with a dialogue to select the <strong>GDS export settings</strong>. You can probably leave most of these as default, but you may wanto change the <strong>output file name</strong> or location, or select whether you want to export the <strong>active cell</strong> only, or <strong>all cells</strong>.

When you output a GDS file from L-edit a log file will be produced inside  your L-Edit design. This file will tell you the export settings and let you know  if there have been any warnings or errors.
