With the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/sqlite-manager/">Firefox SQLite Manager Plugin</a> it's easy to view, update and export <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite </a>databases. It's very easy to install Firefox SQLite Manager, but I found it wasn't obvious how to actually use it.
This post walks you through the steps to load up the manager once you've installed it.
<h1>1. Right Click on The Firefox menu bar and click "Customize..."</h1>
Once you've installed the Firefox SQLite manager, there aren't really any clues about what to do next. We need to drag the plugin icon onto our menu bar.

<h1>2. Find The "SQLite Manager" icon in the "Additional Tools and Features" Pane</h1>
The new Firefox SQLite Manager icon will be in amongst the icons for other plugins you've installed, as well as some of the pre-installed Firefox tools.

<h1>3. Drag The Icon To Your Menu Bar</h1>
It doesn't really matter where you drag the icon - just find space where you can.

<h1>4. Start Using the Firefox SQLite Manager</h1>
Once you've got the icon where you want it you just need to click on it to load up the manager. When you open it up you can either create a new database or work on an existing one, and you'll find all the usual SQL tools available.
