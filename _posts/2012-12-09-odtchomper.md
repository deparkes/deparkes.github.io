I've made a command line interface for the excellent odtchomp, part of <a href="https://math.nist.gov/oommf/contrib/" title="OOMMFTools" target="_blank">OOMMFTools</a>. 
OOMMFTools, written by Mark Mascaro, contains 'odtchomp' which  converts OOMMF odt files into delimited text files. These modified files can be more easily loaded into data plotting/manipulation software.
<a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/~ppxdep/projects/odtchomper" title="odtchomper" target="_blank">odtchomper</a> is a command line interface to the odtchomp component of OOMMFTools. It was designed in such a way that it could be used easily along side an existing OOMMFTools install.
